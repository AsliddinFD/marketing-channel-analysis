## Project background

#### FleetFuel, a U.S.-based B2B fuel solution, helps logistics companies reduce fuel costs using fuel card. I partnered with the Head of Marketing to evaluate marketing channel performance. We focused on acquisition cost, 30-day revenue, customer lifetime value (CLV), churn rate, and engagement score to identify which channels drive the most valuable and loyal customers.

## Executive summary

### A 6-month analysis of 4,892 customer acquisition records highlights consistent monthly growth, averaging 714 new customers. While all marketing channels performed similarly in volume, Organic Search and Referral collectively contributed 33% of total leads, outperforming others in cost-efficiency and return. Organic Search and Email Campaigns delivered the lowest average acquisition costs (USD 1,500 and USD 2,000 respectively), while LinkedIn incurred the highest at approximately USD 11,000 per month. Despite costing more, LinkedIn did not outperform lower-cost channels in customer lifetime value (CLV) or retention. Referral leads had the highest CLV (around USD 800) and the lowest churn rate (10%), compared to Facebook and Google Ads, which shared the highest churn (40%). Notably, Organic Search achieved the strongest CLV-to-Cost ratio at 80x, followed by Referral at 60x. Given Organic Search’s low acquisition cost and exceptional CLV-to-cost ratio (80x), it’s crucial to invest further in SEO to drive more leads at a low cost. The referral program, with its high CLV of 800 and low churn (10%), should be optimized with better incentives to encourage more customer referrals. LinkedIn, with its high acquisition cost of 11,000 per month and lower returns, should be reassessed to determine if the investment is justified, while focusing more on channels like Organic Search and Email Campaigns, which are delivering superior results at a fraction of the cost.

## Recommendations

### Increase investment in Organic Search by expanding SEO content, optimizing site structure, and improving keyword targeting to scale the most cost-efficient channel with an 83x CLV-to-cost ratio.

### Enhance the referral program by offering tiered rewards and personalized referral incentives to capitalize on the highest CLV ($906) and lowest churn rate (12%).

### Cut spending on Facebook and Google Ads unless targeting or conversion paths are improved, as both deliver low efficiency (10x return) and the highest churn (36%).

### Refine email campaign content and segmentation to improve CLV, which is currently the lowest ($503), despite being one of the cheapest channels to acquire customers.

### Audit LinkedIn targeting criteria to boost cost efficiency and reduce churn (28%), since CLV is relatively high ($798) but acquisition cost remains disproportionately high
