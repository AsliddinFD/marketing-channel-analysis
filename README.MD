## Project background

#### This project analyzes sales data from a fuel card agent to identify key patterns in client demographics, spending behavior, and revenue generation. The goal is to provide insights for optimizing sales strategies and improving client targeting.

## Executive summary

### An analysis of the agent’s client portfolio reveals that the USA leads in client count, with the highest number of active, enrolled, and interested clients (29), followed by South America (7). The agent’s clients are primarily located in California and Texas, with 8 and 7 clients respectively. Despite the high client volume from the USA, Iranian clients generated the highest revenue ($78k), attributed to longer tenure with the company. The agent’s most successful lead source is CRM (37 clients), followed by Facebook (13). Notably, clients from web sourcing, though only one, have spent the most money ($78k), surpassing the $55k spent by CRM clients. A key finding is that clients only use the fuel card if they are approved for a credit line, with those rejected yet to use the card.

## Insights Deep-Dive

## Geographics and Revenue Trends

## Top Nationalities by Client Count:
### The majority of clients are from the USA (29), followed by South America (7) and Uzbekistan (4).
## Active Clients by Nationality:
### Despite having the highest number of clients, the USA has only 2 active clients, equal to South America’s 2 active clients.
## Interest and Engagement:
### USA has 20 interested clients, South America has 3. This shows strong top-of-funnel traction but weak conversion for the USA.
## Conversion by State:
### California leads in client conversion count, with 6 clients (2 active), followed by Texas with 7 clients (5 enrolled, 2 interested) but no active clients.
## Top Spending Nationalities:
### Iran leads in total revenue with $78,000 spent, followed by the USA with $27,000 and South America with $18,000.
## High-Spending Client Insight:
### The Iranian client’s high spending is attributed to a longer relationship with the company, driving cumulative revenue higher over time.

## Recommendations

## Double Down on U.S. Lead Generation:
### The agent consistently converts U.S. leads into interested clients. Continue feeding U.S.-based leads into his CRM pipeline to maintain volume.

## Improve Conversion Support:
Assign a senior sales agent to assist with closing deals, particularly for the high volume of U.S. leads that stall at the “interested” stage.

## Leverage Referral Potential:
### Provide targeted training to the agent on building a referral network using his current client base, aiming to generate warm leads at low acquisition cost.

## Investigate Enrollment Drop-off:
### Assign senior agents to evaluate why enrolled clients are not activating their cards, and implement interventions to drive usage and revenue generation.
